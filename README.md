## **2023 RISS Project:  UI Design For Equity-Oriented STEM Rich Making** 

### Short Bio: https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/student/will-scott/

## Background:

This work extends the user interface (UI) developed by Ph. D student Sam Speer (https://github.com/SamS1205/RoboLoom-GUI) to enrich the making experience for marginalized youth when operating the SPEER Loom.
As a member of the 2023 RISS Cohort, this research focuses on human-robot interactions for pedagolical pursuits in marginalized communities.

## *Abstract*

The rapid rise in the maker movement is characterized by the global growth of maker spaces as a platform to promote STEM learning and creativity. In academic spaces and literature,  the maker movement is centered on dismantling accessibility barriers to STEM learning. However, most learning systems in these environments do not leverage the knowledge and practices of communities of color or low-income neighborhoods. Currently, minoritized groups possess extensive knowledge unrecognized by academic spaces due to the historical “feminization” of crafting and artistic-based practices. SPEERLoom is a robotic loom developed by the Social Haptics Robotics and Education (SHRED) Lab designed for makerspace and classroom deployment. SPEERLoom integrates the practice of weaving, a traditional method to expression ones' culture, with typical western math curricula to legitimize the knowledge from minoritized communities. This paper will discuss the design choices implemented to center co-making within SPEERLoom's user interface (UI) to expand interdisciplinary learning within maker spaces. We ground our engineering system in existing learning science theories, such as constructivism, to support the development of equity-oriented STEM making.  This paper will begin to answer the following research questions: how do we center scholars' cultural and communal connections into the fabric of our engineering designs, and how do we redesign our learning systems to center the practice of co-making?

This work was supported by the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS) Program. A special thanks to Rachel Burcin and Dr. John Dolan for providing tremendous academic and mental health support to the cohort this summer, expanding the robotics community to individuals of all backgrounds. I would like to thank my mentors Dr. Melisa Orta Martinez, Ph D. student Sam Speer, and Master's of Architecture student Phoebe Degroots from the Social Haptics Robotics and Education Lab for their continued assistance with this project. These individuals have progressed my critical thinking skills, social awareness, and learning science knowledge beyond any level imaginable for myself. Thank you everyone for making this summer a worthwhile academic and social experience.
